# Rails Camp Adelaide Site

This is the work-in-progress static Rails Camp Adelaide site using Middleman and Bootstrap Sass.

To see the current built version go [here](http://lkhennessy.github.io/rails-camp/)

## To Contribute

Install [Middleman](https://github.com/middleman/middleman)

1. Fork
2. Edit
3. Push
4. Pull

See [Bootstrap Sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) for Bootstrap info.

## Building

"middleman build" command will build locally and should work. When using [MGD](https://github.com/hovancik/middleman-github-deploy) to push site to GitHub Pages file paths are breaking. So what should be "stylesheets/site.css" is "/stylesheets/site.css". Yet to fix this in any way other than manually correcting! It's a pain, will be looking further into it.

## To Do

* Custom url
* Speaker application form
* Format and add sponsor images
* Carousel of Adelaide Hills images
